The final project of the foundations course of odin,
this will test implementations of functions and how they interact
in the form of a calculator on a webpage, combining html, css and 
javascript together in one project. I'm worried whether i'll be
able to do everything fluently, but should be able to get 
a decent amount of things done before i get stuck.
